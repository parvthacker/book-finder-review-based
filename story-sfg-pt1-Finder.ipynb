Out of that morsel Asimov managed to write a novel exploring parallel universes, alien societies, the Big Bang, space exploration and lunar colonies.  This is classic Asimov proving why he was so prolific, turning a basic question into a fully fledge hypothesis in the form of a novel. Typically for him, the prose isn't the strongest and the final third of the book is rather weak, but for some solid science fiction (and extra points for the excellent use of a Schiller quote) you could do worse than this.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSelect 2 for:\n\nGoodreads:       https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167572\nReview Text:     To start off with, the title is a fallacy: there's no war here, long or otherwise.  Instead, the book has the exact same problem as the original: It's a dozen or so characters in search of a plot. Baxter and Pratchett do a marvelous job of continuing to explore the ramifications of the Long Earth, but that's about all the book is. Beyond that we get some disconnected stories of various individuals that we're not really that attached to.  If you thought the setup in the first book would be paid out by some actual plot in the second, you're going to be disappointed.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSelect 3 for:\n\nGoodreads:       https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327770\nReview Text:     2.75  Ummm. So I found this book a little strange. It was an odd mix of fractured nonsense and pieces of a good story. It was almost like a short story collection pretending to be a solidified novel. I do wish Koontz had focused more on Grady and Cammy's tale and culled out the other awkward threads, but that being said, I didn't hate the book. I almost admire Koontz for trying to write outside the box- sci fi, mysticism, and social commentary are blended in a manner that he's never attempted before. The blend didn't really gel, but kudos for the attempt.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSelect 4 for:\n\nGoodreads:       https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26115647\nReview Text:     Drown is a pretty straightforward telling of the original Little Mermaid. The author takes this tragic fairy tale and twists the knife a little more, largely a successful endeavor with satisfactory results. Very little originality is displayed overall, but this works in favor of the timeless narrative.  At times, the prose is obviously artificial, trying too hard for the feeling of an old tale, such as the consistent repetition of sentences beginning with \"For.\" \"For the prince had dreamed long about the orange trees\" etc... The author's inexperience was consistent with an ebook author, and overall the story worked out well. I loved/hated the ending.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSelect 5 for:\n\nGoodreads:       https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821011\nReview Text:     This book was an EXPERIENCE. I almost put it down four times because the writing was driving me crazy, but picked it up because of plot.  Basically, the work building is jumping off the page at you, crazy full of imagination and cool ideas. The plot is stacked layers and layers deep of mistaken identity, amnesia, curses, dragons, princesses, betrayal, friendship, fashion, Etc. And I found the writing style very, very difficult. The author is an accomplished script writer, and I think that comes through. There is a great deal of \"telling\" and almost no \"showing\". Lots of cool visuals, set pieces in repeated places (areas \"on set\" you may even say), mysterious pasts everywhere. It would make an AMAZING tv show or movie.\n--------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Select & Get Data from Web","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    top_k = 5\n    \n    # Prompt selection\n    number = get_valid_number_input(f\"Please enter a number between 1 and {top_k}: \", 1, top_k)\n    selected_book_id = top_5_book_ids[number-1]\n    \n    print(\"You selected:\", number)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-17T21:37:09.686942Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-17T21:37:09.687822Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-17T21:38:00.031827Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-17T21:37:09.687792Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-17T21:38:00.030726Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"Please enter a number between 1 and 5:  1\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"You selected: 1\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Scrape book data\nbook_data = extract_book_info(selected_book_id)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-17T21:38:00.033133Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-17T21:38:00.033470Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.458851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-17T21:38:00.033440Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.457420Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print (\"You have Selected:\")\nprint (f\"Title:           {book_data['title']}\")\nprint (f\"Rating:          {book_data['rating']} • ({book_data['ratings_count']} Ratings & {book_data['reviews_count']} Reviews)\")\nprint (f\"Description:     {book_data['description']}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.463116Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.464247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.471266Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.464210Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-17T21:38:02.469670Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"You have Selected:\nTitle:           The Gods Themselves\nRating:          4.09 • (63494 Ratings & 2673 Reviews)\nDescription:     In the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens.
